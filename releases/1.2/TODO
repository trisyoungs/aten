Issues with the current version:
	- Spherical regions in disordered builder have poor randomness.

General To-Do list:
	- Molecular dynamics
	- Calculate average molecule geometry (analyse)
	- Add CG (needs testing) / simplex / other minimisers
	- View Miller planes
	- EPS export

Forcefield To-Do list:
	- UFF - oxidation state, torsions
	- GAFF
	- Tripos 5.2
	- OPLS (types)

Filters To-Do list:
	- EPSR Ato import / export?

General Qt To-Do list:
	- Forcefield edit window
	- Better editability in the atomlist stack page

Optimisation To-Do list:
	- Hemispherical Ewald summmation
	- For large systems (10000+ atoms) autocreate_patterns() is a bottleneck, as is model::copy(model*)
