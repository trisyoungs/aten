Issues with the current version:
	- Save image provokes GLXBadExtension error when incorrect/no 3D graphics driver installed.
	- Spherical regions in disordered builder have poor randomness.
	- OpenGL transparency issues (polygon artefacts - need ordering?)
	- Automatic bond augmenting needs rewrite (currently disabled)
	- GL backface culling option (gl backcull on) renders incorrectly.

General To-Do list:
	- Ewald sum (fourier calculation, reciprocal cell) for non-orthogonal cells
	- Molecular dynamics
	- Calculate average molecule geometry (analyse)
	- Add CG (needs testing) / simplex / other minimisers
	- View Miller planes
	- Better EPS export

Forcefield To-Do list:
	- UFF - oxidation state, torsions
	- GAFF
	- Tripos 5.2
	- OPLS (types)

Filters To-Do list:
	- EPSR Ato import / export?
	- 'within' function?

General Qt To-Do list:
	- Forcefield edit window
	- Better editability in the atomlist stack page
	- Remember positions / visibility of toolbars (QSettings)

Optimisation To-Do list:
	- Hemispherical Ewald summmation
	- For large systems (10000+ atoms) autocreate_patterns() is a bottleneck, as is model::copy(model*)
