Forcefields supplied with Aten are, to the best intentions, complete and accurate, but no
guarantee of this is made (its free software after all). It is wise to check by hand the 
types applied to your system by Aten, at least until you are confident that everything is
okay with a forcefield.  OPLS-AA  in particular is very large and missing many descriptions.

So, be thorough and check any forcefield expressions you export. If you find any mistakes or
add any useful information to a forcefield, please contact me so the files can be updated.
