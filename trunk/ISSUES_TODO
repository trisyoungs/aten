Issues with the current version:
	- Save image provokes GLXBadExtension error when incorrect/no 3D graphics driver installed.
	- Spherical regions in disordered builder have poor randomness.
	- OpenGL transparency issues (polygon artefacts - need ordering?)
	- Surfaces need correct vertex normals
	- Colour schemes other than AC_ELEMENT need to be fixed
	- Switching between perspective / orthographic views loses current rotation/zoom

General To-Do list:
	- Ewald sum (fourier calculation, reciprocal cell?) for non-orthogonal cells
	- Molecular dynamics
	- Calculate average molecule geometry (analyse)
	- Complete spacegroups list
	- Add CG (needs testing) / simplex / other minimisers
	- View along cell axes
	- View Miller planes
	- Undo / Redo
	- Export EPS

Forcefield To-Do list:
	- UFF - oxidation state, torsions
	- GAFF
	- Tripos 5.2
	- OPLS (types)

Filters To-Do list:
	- Accelrys MSI import
	- EPSR Ato import / export?
	- Full pdb import (from spec)
	- 'within' function

General Qt To-Do list:
	- AddHydrogen needs an icon
	- Forcefield stack page and manager/edit window
		+ Need method to apply forcefield to all or selected pattern
		+ Method of assigning individual types by hand (also in atom context menu?)
	- Prefs window (partial) - colour editor (e.g. for COL_PEN, COL_BG etc.)
	- List of non-periodic models in disorder stack page (with checkboxes?)
	- Better editability in the atom list stack page
	- Bond tolerance widget in Edit page
	- Remember positions / visibility of toolbars (QSettings)

Manual To-Do list:
	- Section on forcefields
	- Section on Qt GUI
	- Filters Handbook is incomplete
	- Tutorials

Optimisation To-Do list:
	- Hemispherical Ewald summmation
	- Filters / variable_list - can enum and store common variable pointers (e.g. "e", "r.x") to save lookup time
	- For large systems (10000+ atoms) autocreate_patterns() is a bottleneck, as is model::copy(model*)
	- Disorder builder - avoid needless energy calculation
