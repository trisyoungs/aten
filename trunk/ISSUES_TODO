Issues with the current version:
	- Closing main window with [x] does not ask to save modified models.
	- Save image provokes GLXBadExtension error (on some cards), affects canvas on others.
	- Spherical regions in disordered builder have poor randomness.
	- Interpolation of surface triangles is 'simple' (0.5 along edges)
	- OpenGL transparency issues (polygon artefacts - need ordering?)

General To-Do list:
	- Ewald sum (fourier calculation, reciprocal cell?) for non-orthogonal cells
	- Molecular dynamics
	- Calculate average molecule geometry (analyse)
	- Complete spacegroups list
	- UFF - oxidation state, energy conversion, torsions, angle periodicity
	- Improve SD minimiser
	- Add NR / simplex minimisers
	- View along cell axes (or Miller planes)
	- Reset view (whole model on screen)
	- Accelrys MSI import filter
	- EPSR Ato import / export? filters

General Qt To-Do list:
	- Forcefield stack page and manager/edit window
	- Prefs window (partial)
	- Minimiser stack page (partial)
	- Disorder stack page (partial)
	- Trajectory playback
	- Progress dialogs are not application modal

Manual To-Do list:
	- Section on forcefields
	- Section on Qt GUI
	- Filters Handbook is incomplete 

Optimisation To-Do list:
	- Hemispherical Ewald summmation
	- Filters / variable_list - can enum and store common variable pointers (e.g. "e", "r.x") to save lookup time
	- For large systems (10000+ atoms) autocreate_patterns() is a bottleneck, as is model::copy(model*)
