Remove empty destructors.
Add ObjectLists (when using CHECK)?
Sort out layout of headers (double-line gap etc.).
Move sg code to separate dir.
Move math funcs/classes (e.g. Matrix) to separate dir.
Remove dialog pointers (use instances instead).
Remove Scripts menu, and automatic loading of scripts on startup.
Fix callbacks for atom picking etc.
Add new RefList definition.
Move Prefs from being a static global to a member of Aten.
Split gui/mainmenu_actions.cpp into menu_* files.
In AtenWindow::on_actionFileSaveImage_triggered convert options to proper QDialog.
Add large image creation functions.
Redo ProgressIndicator, making into a class much like QProgress (can't just use QProgress, since we want to have progress indicator functionality in the CLI....). Make it clever enough to realise that the gui is visible or not. Perhaps integrate it into Messenger, so that messages printed out while the indicator is running don't disrupt the indicator?
Remove global Fourier declaration, and make it local to each Model.
Remove global MC, CG, SD declarations, and put them in Aten?
Remove 'current_' Bundle containing current Model, ForceField, Atom etc. and move all commands depending on them to be functions of other variable types.
Reimplement KeepNames functionality.
Split methods/partitiondata* into partitiondata and partitionscheme.
Add in calculation of quantities and graphing.
Make ZMatrix a full member of Model, rather than a pointer that needs to be created.
Crash if model is saved, then filters reloaded, then model is saved again (since filter pointer will be wrong)?
In top-left corner of main window, have a black icon illustrating which mode is active (except for Interact).
Instead of a separate AtenVariable, make Aten subclass Variable?
Rename source files for parser/parser (grammar etc.) a la uChroma.
Make ElementMap store reference to Aten, preventing passing of FFs, typeMapping data etc (and fix name-mapping).
Implement optional startup 'guide' or 'wizard' that will disable all controls on the GUI and explain what means what, highlighting them as appropriate.
Scale molecule COM inverts coordinates??
Reformulate Pattern::bondEnergy() and others into a separate class, since the Pattern class shouldn't really own them.
Use indices in rendering Primitives.
Change SaveImageDialog to check for empty image filename, and disable OK button accordingly.
Check - is using redirected filenames really necessary when saveing movie frame images?
Fix image saving - in particular scaling & offset when saving large image (what role will/did ViewLayout play?)
Make UserActions a member of something (Viewer?).
Fix Grid rimitive generation (need to know nVertices ahead of time...).
Optimise basic primitives to use vertex/index arrays instead of just vertices (also check end caps of spheres).
Check picked atom rendering (probably broken).
Optimise primitive drawing / generation by allowing use of GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP?
Note not related to Aten2 - pdens visualising areas of low probability (less than bulk) to see excluded areas?
Sort out recent files list - not working?
Octahedral Growing doesn't work.
Add option to specify grow distance (instead of calculating from VDW radii).
Draw halo underneath current model when more than one model is displayed.
Automatically adjust grid size for number of visible models, based on current aspect ratio and context size etc.

GUI TODO:
AddAtom functionality (from old Build menu).

Manual TODO:
Remove level of detail and transparency options from Prefs.
More examples (e.g. slab generation)
Remove 'gui' keyword.
Remove 'calcEnergy' optional args from scaleMolecules and scaleCell.
Remove replaceChars (after command is removed).
Remove frameCurrent* from Prefs accessors.
