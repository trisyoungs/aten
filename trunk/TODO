Known Bugs
----------

o Function arguments can be passed to array-requiring paths without complaint (e.g. old p.com, now a function)
o Rebonding model also folds atoms, making --nofold irrelevant
o Atom list update is super-slow when changing selection in big systems - This is an issue with Qt, and doesn't appear to have a resolution at present.
o Fragment builder does not clear properly once closed.
o Flickering Progress Dialog, e.g. when using disordered builder on Windows
o Undoing cell changes with the Cell Define window open does not change the cell window itself, and the original values are re-set when closing the window.
o Model List images do not update. Can the main view be grabbed and shrunk down to icon size? Maybe in a QThread?
o Tetrahedron glyph display is broken (e.g. in watermethane.txt script). All glyphs?
o Tab ordering on many tool windows is erratic

Current TODO
------------

o Cancel mode if a tool window is closed when one of its modes is selected?
o PovRay export
o Save forcefield!
o Add method to check current pattern definition so that it doesn't have to be removed so often.
o More verbosity for all commands
o Detect corrupt canvas by rendering a small offscreen bitmap and checking colour?
o Make access through PatternBound to FFBound a bit easier - add accessor to FFBound data?
o Update script to perform conformational searching on molecule (add GUI options)
o Glyph Undo/Redo
o Allow (somehow) rotation of fragments without drawing them *or* rotating main view
o Add on glyph selection methods (a la box select with the mouse)

Filter TODO
-----------

o Add options to FIELD import filter, allowing application of pattern to model.
o Add more options to GAMESS-US inp filter: MD options
o Storage of grid data in AKF format

Manual TODO
-----------

o Add new image for atom list
o Chapter / Section on Basic View / Imaging.
o Disorder builder method information and section.
