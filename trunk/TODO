New TODO:
Transparency correction (separate branch)
Grid colourisation is wrong (will probably be fixed in new rendering engine.
Ellipsoid (CG particle example) display broken?
Add ability for AKF file to save (links to) loaded grid data, along with colour and style info (needs new grid data accessors)
Fix spacegroup usage - for example, when only symmetry operators (and no spacegroup) are defined in file, Mercury succeeds but Aten does not!
