<h1>Known Bugs</h1>

<ul>
<li>Function arguments can be passed to array-requiring paths without complaint (e.g. old p.com, now a function)</li>
<li>Rebonding model also folds atoms, making --nofold irrelevant</li>
<li>Atom list update is super-slow when changing selection in big systems - This is an issue with Qt, and doesn't appear to have a resolution at present.</li>
<li>Fragment builder does not clear properly once closed.</li>
<li>Flickering Progress Dialog, e.g. when using disordered builder on Windows</li>
<li>Model List images do not update. Can the main view be grabbed and shrunk down to icon size? Maybe in a QThread?</li>
<li>Glyph list not update on model load.</li>
<li>Model not updated when changing glyph selection?</li>
<li>Segfault in Model::regenerateIcon() from Qt's renderText (laptop)?</li>
</ul>
o Running in console mode, relations between widgets (e.g. radio group buttons) are not honoured correctly

<h1>Current TODO</h1>

<ul>
<li>PovRay export</li>
<li>Save forcefield needs to be able to distinguish between types and uatypes, and 'convert' data is not yet written.</li>
<li>Add method to check current pattern definition so that it doesn't have to be removed so often.</li>
<li>Detect corrupt canvas by rendering a small offscreen bitmap and checking colour?</li>
<li>Make access through PatternBound to FFBound a bit easier - add accessor to FFBound data?</li>
<li>Update script to perform conformational searching on molecule (add GUI options)</li>
<li>Glyph Undo/Redo</li>
<li>Allow (somehow) rotation of fragments without drawing them *or* rotating main view</li>
<li>Add on glyph selection methods (a la box select with the mouse)</li>
<li>Manual - Chapter / Section on Basic View / Imaging.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Filter TODO</h1>

<ul>
<li>Add options to FIELD import filter, allowing application of pattern to model.</li>
<li>Add more options to GAMESS-US inp filter: MD options</li>
<li>Storage of grid data in AKF format</li>
</ul>

<h1>Manual TODO</h1>

<ul>
<li>Add new image for atom list, glyph window, and disorder options</li>
<li>Disorder builder method information and section.</li>
</ul>
