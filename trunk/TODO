Thigs to test in new version:

1) Cell packing (vs Mercury)
2) MatrixTransform of model

Things to do (fix) in new version:

1) Rotation of multiple bonds into bond plane
2) Jump before first rotation of model (lastmouse not set properly?)

General TODO:

1) Make bond drawing same as chain drawing (i.e. can click-drag *or* click-move-click
2) Script to add H-bonds to pair of selected atoms
3) Script to perform conformational searching on molecule
4) Switch (checkbox) to prevent folding of atoms when rotating / translating with mouse (in Build window?)
5) More stuff on Grids window - e.g. number of points, grid extent, volume etc.
6) Tabulated trigonometric functions (in mathfunc.h) for rendering optimisation
7) Glyph Undo/Redo
8) Spacegroup Pnmmm
9) Allow (somehow) rotation of fragments without drawing them *or* rotating main view
a) Replacing existing bond in fragment builder causes wrong atoms to be deleted
b) Double-press of ALT required to cycle over fragment attachment points? Or just that view isn't updated?
c) Undo/Redo of cell addition not working properly?
d) Build Window tool to transmute current atom selection

Filter TODO:
1) ECP type is not written in GAMESS-US export filter
2) Add more options to GAMESS-US inp filter, inc. specification of how to write elements (full name / symbol), MD options etc.
3) Storage of grid data in AKF format.

Doc TODO:

1) Topic: Colourscales
2) Topic: Glyphs
