Description: Atomic configuration creator and editor
 Aten allows configurations suitable for molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and ab initio codes
 to be created easily. Periodic and non-periodic systems can be generated automatically or
 built by hand, and spacegroup packing (i.e. support for crystals) is implemented. Aten is 
 fully scriptable and support for any file format (be it a model file, gridded data, or 
 forcefield description) can be added through the filters system.
