\chapter{Features}

\progname{} was designed with the needs of the molecular dynamics user in mind, but is more than likely to be useful in more general situations as well. At its simplest, it is (another) visualiser -- at its most complex, it is a forcefield-based tool for the creation and editing of gas- and liquid-phase configurations, offering an advanced atom typing system, energy minimisation, Monte Carlo methods for the creation of disordered systems, energy / force calculation, and tools for analysis.\\

\begin{optlist}{In a nutshell:}
	\item Load, display, save (images or coordinates) model files.
	\item Draw, edit, add, delete, move, position, and rotate atoms.
	\item Display, add, and edit unit cells (including spacegroup packing).
	\item Load and apply atom typing and forcefield terms to models.
	\item Calculate energies / forces.
	\item Geometry minimise structures.
\end{optlist}

Detailed feature information:\\

\begin{optlist}{Visualising}
	\item Visualise molecules / systems / trajectories in glorious line, tube, sphere and scaled sphere styles (or an arbitrary mix).
	\item Play movies of molecular dynamics trajectories.
	\item Save image snapshots.
\end{optlist}
