	<sect5><title>General Format</title>
		<para>The atom list shows, unsurprisingly, a list of all atoms in the model, displaying elements, charges, and positions. If ((Patterns)) have been defined for the model, the atoms in the list will be grouped according to their encompassing pattern, otherwise they are listed in one continuous run.</para>
		
	</sect5>
	
	<sect5><title>Atom Selection</title>
		<para>The selection of items in the atom list mirrors the selection in the current model - (de)selecting atoms in one will also (de)select them in the other. If patterns are defined, (de)selecting the pattern name in the list (de)selects all atoms making up the pattern.</para>
	</sect5>
	
	<sect5><title>Changing the Order of Atoms</title>
		<para>The four buttons at the foot of the atom list allow the current selection of atoms to be moved up and down the list, useful for reordering atoms into a specific sequence. Selected atoms can be shifted up/down the list one place at a time, or all moved to the top or bottom of the list at once. In the latter case the order of the original selection is preserved.</para>
	</sect5>
	
	<sect5><title>Editing Atom Properties</title>
		<para>Editing of atom properties through the atom list is not available in the current version.XXX Is THIS true?</para>
