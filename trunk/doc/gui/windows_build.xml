	<sect5><title>Add Atom</title>

		<para>The Add Atom group allows atoms to be created at specific positions in the model. Coordinates are entered and the atom created (with element defined by the current selected element in the Build toolbar) by pressing the Add button. If the 'Fractional Coordinates' checkbox is ticked the coordinates are assumed to be fractional and are converted to cell coordinates as the atom is added. For example, setting coordinates to {0.5,0.5,0.5} will create an atom in the centre of the current unit cell.</para>

	<sect5><title>Options</title>

		<para>When transforming atoms in a periodic system with the mouse (i.e. rotating or translating them) if any move outside the unit cell as a result of the transformation they are automatically folded back in to the confines of the cell. If the 'Prevent Folding' checkbox is ticked, folding operations are prevented.</para>
