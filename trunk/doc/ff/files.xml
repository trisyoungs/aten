	<para>If you're doing anything interesting with a model or a molecule, a suitable forcefield description of the system is a must. A forcefield contains lists of parameters that describe the interactions between atoms, for example bonds, angles, and van der Waals interactions. More specifically, a forcefield contains parameters to describe many such interactions in many different types of molecule or chemical environment. An 'ex&lt;x&gt;pression', referred to throughout the manual, should be thought of as the subset of terms from a given forcefield necessary to describe all the interactions within a model.</para>
	
	<para>Aten has its own free format for forcefield files, described below. Once loaded in, the energy and forces in Models can then be calculated, and allows energy minimisation etc. More so, once a set of forcefield parameters has been read in and used to describe a model, this expression can be written out using a custom format ready for input into something else.</para>

		<para>The format is keyword-based and as simple as possible. Most input is enclosed within blocks, beginning with a keyword and terminated after several lines of data with and 'end' statement. As an example of the overall structure of a forcefield, consider the simple point charge (SPC) forcefield for water as is provided with Aten:</para>

			HW      OW      HW      4184.0  1.62398
			end
		</synopsis>
		
		<para>After giving the forcefield a name and defining the energy units used for the parameters, the two types of atom described by the forcefield (OW and HW) are listed. A unique id, type name, base element, and type description are provided, providing Aten with all it needs to be able to recognise and type these atoms within a model. For each of these types the van der Waals data are provided in the Lennard-Jones style ('inter lj') - again, the type id and type name are specified, followed by the atomic charge and the epsilon and sigma values. Finally, the single bond and angle within the molecule are defined. The type names involved in the interactions are given, followed by the necessary parameters for the functional form specified ('constraint' for the bond, and 'bondconstraint' for the angle). And that's it. Detailed explanations of each section follow.</para>
