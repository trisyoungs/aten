                                *** Introduction ***

Aten is a code to do 'stuff' with coordinates / starting configurations for
computational chemistry and physics codes. It was written primarily as a 
means for brushing up on C++ and OpenGL but has ballooned into something 
that I find useful most days at work as a researcher.

Aten is not guaranteed to work, and is not a full-time project (paid work always
gets preference!). However fixes and code extensions will be made where possible, and 
contributions (especially forcefields and filters) are welcome.

Find a bug? Report it.

Suggestions / comments? Send them on, but be original (writing "Your code sucks."
is fair enough, but be brave and give a little detail).

Want to add something in? Great! E-mail me about it. This software is provided
under the GPL, so you can take / change / redistribute at will, but it would be
nice to be putting everything into the same pot.


                                *** Installation ***

Full instructions can be found in the manual. Briefly:

1) Run './autogen.sh' (if you got Aten via svn)

2) Run './configure' without options use standard locations and build in the Qt GUI.
	Use --prefix to specify the install location
	Use --with-gui to specify a different gui (currently 'qt', 'gtk', or 'none')
	Use --with-qt=framework to use native Qt installation from TrollTech on Macs,
		otherwise use --with-qt=fink to use the Fink-installed version. Leave
		blank to take your chances!

3) Run 'make'.

4) Run 'make install' as root or, if you wish, put the code where you want it.
	Note for custom installs: the contents of the 'data' directory must be
	in a location accessible to all users.

5) Set the environment variable ATENDATA to point to the installed data files.
	For my default configuration (SuSE Linux 10.2) it's /usr/local/share/aten.
	For example, using 'bash': export ATENDATA='/usr/local/share/aten'.
	It's a good idea to put this in your .login, .bashrc or whatever is relevant.
