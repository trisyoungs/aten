Add ObjectLists (when using CHECK)?
Remove dialog pointers (use instances instead).
Remove Scripts menu, and automatic loading of scripts on startup.
Fix callbacks for atom picking etc.
Add new RefList definition.
Move Prefs from being a static global to a member of Aten?
In AtenWindow::on_actionFileSaveImage_triggered convert options to proper QDialog.
Add large image creation functions.
Redo ProgressIndicator, making into a class much like QProgress (can't just use QProgress, since we want to have progress indicator functionality in the CLI....). Make it clever enough to realise that the gui is visible or not. Perhaps integrate it into Messenger, so that messages printed out while the indicator is running don't disrupt the indicator?
Remove global MC, CG, SD declarations, and put them in Aten?
Reimplement KeepNames functionality.
Add in calculation of quantities and graphing?
Crash if model is saved, then filters reloaded, then model is saved again (since filter pointer will be wrong)?
In top-left corner of main window, have a black icon illustrating which mode is active (except for Interact).
Instead of a separate AtenVariable, make Aten subclass Variable?
Make ElementMap store reference to Aten, preventing passing of FFs.
Implement optional startup 'guide' or 'wizard' that will disable all controls on the GUI and explain what means what, highlighting them as appropriate.
Scale molecule COM inverts coordinates??
Reformulate Pattern::bondEnergy() and others into a separate class, since the Pattern class shouldn't really own them.
Change SaveImageDialog to check for empty image filename, and disable OK button accordingly.
Check - is using redirected filenames really necessary when saveing movie frame images?
Fix image saving - in particular scaling & offset when saving large image (what role will/did ViewLayout play?)
Make UserActions a member of something (Viewer?).
Optimise basic primitives to use vertex/index arrays instead of just vertices (also check end caps of spheres).
Check picked atom rendering (probably broken).
Optimise primitive drawing / generation by allowing use of GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP?
Octahedral Growing doesn't work.
Add option to specify grow distance (instead of calculating from VDW radii).
Automatically adjust grid size for number of visible models, based on current aspect ratio and context size etc.
Cif/mol2/pdb import broken?
Clear selected measurements on panel popup clears all measurements.
CRASH - Click in empty space in model list causes fp exception. Related to no current model selected.  Force ListWidget to always have one selected?
Allow right-click on elements in PTable to set as member of common elements popup.
Finish Spacegroup popup.
Add Calculate tool to work out centre of geometry/mass.
Add option to display ColourScale selector (e.g. for Grid colour buttons)
Reimplement drawing of grid (volume) axes.
Make Model::EnergyStore a private member with accessor?
Click to select grid.
Have Tools page? With, for instance:
--- Plot Orbital (raising dialog from old GridsWidget).
Remove TColourFrame (after updating Prefs and Glyphs windows).
Have small, additional black icons at top-right of each model window, illustrating whether it has been modified, is displaying trajetory frames, etc.
Context Menu:
o Set Colour doesn't work, since it needs a colour selector popup.
Recent files list - enable load on double-click, settings not loaded/saved properly?
TMenuButton - after (long-) click to show popup, allow popup to be hidden with no actions if the button is clicked on again.
When messages display is on top, pass wheel event onto MessagesScroll.
Button to calculate / show total charge in selection.
Build option - keep centred.

AddAtom functionality (from old Build menu).

Manual TODO:
Remove level of detail and transparency options from Prefs.
More examples (e.g. slab generation)
Remove 'gui' keyword.
Remove 'calcEnergy' optional args from scaleMolecules and scaleCell.
Remove replaceChars (after command is removed).
Remove frameCurrent* from Prefs accessors.
Added SetAngles, SetDistances, and SetTorsions commands.
Add GridStyleSecondary command (GridStyle now explicitly for primary surface).
Change enum entries for Grid::SurfaceStyle.
Add GridOutline and GridPeriodic commands.
Rename (De)SelectFor to (De)SelectCode.
Remove ManualSwapBuffers from Prefs accessor.
