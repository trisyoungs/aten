				<row>
					<entry>alpha</entry>

				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>firstalpha</entry>
					<entry>Convert based on the first alpha part of the name only (i.e. until a non-alpha character is found). The alpha part is assumed to be an element symbol</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>name</entry>

				</row>
				<row>
