Thigs to test in new version:

2) Cell packing (vs Mercury)
5) Viewing along (cell) axes
6) Ewald energies / forces
7) Torsion forces
8) Matrix transformation operations on Model (specifically 'matrixtransform')

Things to do (fix) in new version:

1) Rendering of aromatic bonds
2) Rotation of multiple bonds into bond plane
5) Jump before first rotation of model (lastmouse not set properly?)
a) Testing of CG particle script
f) Proper positioning of bond halves w.r.t. outer edge of atom

General TODO:

1) Make bond drawing same as chain drawing (i.e. can click-drag *or* click-move-click
2) Script to add H-bonds to pair of selected atoms
3) Script to perform conformational searching on molecule
4) Better control over MOPAC output (filter options)
5) Loading scripts should not cause duplicate scripts to be remembered (Qt contains an isSameFile function or something similar).
6) Switch (checkbox) to prevent folding of atoms when rotating / translating with mouse (in Build window?)
7) More stuff on Grids window - e.g. number of points, grid extent, volume etc.
8) Tabulated trigonometric functions (in mathfunc.h) for rendering optimisation
9) Glyph Undo/Redo
a) Spacegroup Pnmmm

Doc TODO:

1) Topic: Colourscales
2) Topic: Glyphs
