Thigs to test in new version:

2) Cell display / packing (vs Mercury)
3) Disordered building (with points)
5) Viewing along (cell) axes
6) Ewald energies / forces
7) Torsion forces
8) Matrix transformation operations on Model (specifically 'matrixtransform')

Things to do in new version:

1) Drawing of aromatic bonds
2) Rotation of multiple bonds into bond plane
3) Scaling of RMB transformation is wrong (too slow)
