Thigs to test in new version:

2) Cell packing (vs Mercury)
3) Disordered building (with points)
5) Viewing along (cell) axes
6) Ewald energies / forces
7) Torsion forces
8) Matrix transformation operations on Model (specifically 'matrixtransform')

Things to do (fix) in new version:

1) Drawing of aromatic bonds
2) Rotation of multiple bonds into bond plane
5) Jump before first rotation of model (lastmouse not set properly?)
6) Orthographic view completely broken.
7) Switch (checkbox) to prevent folding of atoms when rotating / translating with mouse (in Build window?)
8) Prefs option to render quality for saved bitmaps, automatically applied at save time (need to store quality of last generated primitives in Engine).
