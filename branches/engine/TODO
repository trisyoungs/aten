Thigs to test in new version:

1) Cell packing (vs Mercury)
2) MatrixTransform of model

Things to do (fix) in new version:

1) Rotation of multiple bonds into bond plane
2) Jump before first rotation of model (lastmouse not set properly?)

General TODO:

1) Make bond drawing same as chain drawing (i.e. can click-drag *or* click-move-click
2) Script to add H-bonds to pair of selected atoms
3) Script to perform conformational searching on molecule
4) Loading scripts should not cause duplicate scripts to be remembered (Qt contains an isSameFile function or something similar).
5) Switch (checkbox) to prevent folding of atoms when rotating / translating with mouse (in Build window?)
6) More stuff on Grids window - e.g. number of points, grid extent, volume etc.
7) Tabulated trigonometric functions (in mathfunc.h) for rendering optimisation
8) Glyph Undo/Redo
9) Spacegroup Pnmmm
a) Allow (somehow) rotation of fragments without drawing them *or* rotating main view
b) Replacing existing bond in fragment builder causes wrong atoms to be deleted
c) Double-press of ALT required to cycle over fragment attachment points? Or just that view isn't updated?
d) Undo/Redo of cell addition not working properly?
e) Build Window tool to transmute current atom selection

Filter TODO:
1) ECP type is not written in GAMESS-US export filter
2) Add more options to GAMESS-US inp filter, inc. specification of how to write elements (full name / symbol), MD options etc.
3) Better control over MOPAC output (filter options)

Doc TODO:

1) Topic: Colourscales
2) Topic: Glyphs
