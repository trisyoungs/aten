Thigs to test in new version:

2) Cell packing (vs Mercury)
5) Viewing along (cell) axes
6) Ewald energies / forces
7) Torsion forces
8) Matrix transformation operations on Model (specifically 'matrixtransform')

Things to do (fix) in new version:

1) Rendering of aromatic bonds
2) Rotation of multiple bonds into bond plane
5) Jump before first rotation of model (lastmouse not set properly?)
7) Switch (checkbox) to prevent folding of atoms when rotating / translating with mouse (in Build window?)
a) Glyphs, including render test akf (inc. lots more stuff besides)
b) More stuff on Grids window - e.g. number of points, grid extent, volume etc.
c) Spacegroup Pnmmm
e) Tabulated trigonometric functions (in mathfunc.h)
