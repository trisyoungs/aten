= Installation =

After a successful compilation is complete you're left with the Aten executable in {{{src/}}} (with Autotools) or in {{{bin/}}} (with CMake). It's up to you now whether you install it system-wide automatically or by hand.


Run {{{make install}}} to place the program in a system {{{bin/}}} directory (the Autotools default is commonly {{{/usr/local/bin}}}) if you have root privileges. Alternatively, copy the program to a local location of your choice and run it from there.


Aten needs its filter stock to be able to read and write data. The default stock of filters is installed in the default location (commonly {{{/use/local/share/aten}}} if you run {{{make install}}}, or in the directory specified by the {{{--prefix}} option given to {{{./configure}}}. Regardless of where the default filters are installed, Aten is directed to them via the $ATENDATA environment variable which must be set for each user, or perhaps in a suitable {{{/etc/profile.d/}}} script. Aten will not run without them.


If you haven't (or can't) run {{{make install}}} then setting $ATENDATA to the /data directory in the source tree is just fine.
