= Installation =

After a successful compilation is complete you're left with the Aten executable in {{{src/}}} (with Autotools) or in {{{bin/}}} (with CMake). It's up to you now whether you install it system-wide automatically or by hand.


Run {{{make install}}} to place the program in a system {{{bin/}}} directory (the Autotools default is commonly {{{/usr/local/bin}}}, but the RPM default is {{{/usr/bin}}}) if you have root privileges. Alternatively, copy the program to a local location of your choice and run it from there.


Aten needs its filter stock to be able to read and write data. The default stock of filters is installed in the default location (commonly {{{/usr/local/share/aten}}} if you run {{{make install}}}, or in the directory specified by the {{{--prefix}}} option given to {{{./configure}}}. Aten knows of a couple of default locations to search, but on occasions when these fail (for exotic install locations) it can be directed with the $ATENDATA environment variable. If required, $ATENDATA must be set for each user, or perhaps in a suitable {{{/etc/profile.d/}}} script.


If you haven't (or can't) run {{{make install}}} then setting $ATENDATA to the absolute path of the {{{/data}}} directory in the source tree is just fine.
