= Four (Five) Step Guide to Building Aten =

==Requirements==
  * GNU Autotools >=2.6 or CMake >=2.4.8
  * Qt4 >=4.2 (plus development packages)
  * A C++ compiler (e.g. GNU g++, Intel's icc)
  * OpenGL
  * pkg-config (for Linux users, and fink/Darwin installations of Qt4 on Macs)


==0. Retrieve the source for Aten==


==1. Install Qt4==

Aten needs Trolltech's Qt4 libraries, which can be downloaded from [http://trolltech.com]. Most Linux distributions will have it installed already, but may not have the development libraries (libqt4-devel) installed as standard.

For the Mac, an installable disk image is available from [http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/mac], near the bottom of the page. Alternatively, Qt4 is available on Fink. 

To build against the qt4-x11 package available via Fink run:

configure -with-qt=fink ...

This will set most of the necessary environment variables, namely:

    * QTGUI_CFLAGS='-I/sw/lib/qt4-x11/include -I/usr/X11R6/include'
    * QTGUI_LIBS='-L/sw/lib/qt4-x11/lib -lQtGui -lQtCore -lQtOpenGL'
    * QTOPENGL_CFLAGS='-I/sw/lib/qt4-x11/include'
    * QTOPENGL_LIBS='-I/sw/lib/qt4-x11/lib'

You may also need to direct the build process to the correct Qt4 development binaries either by setting your $PATH to `/sw/lib/qt4-x11/bin:${PATH}' or by using the -with-qtdir option to configure.

The native Qt4 package is available as a disk image installer at no cost directly from http://trolltech.com. Specify that the build use the frameworks so provided instead:

configure -with-qt=framework ...


==1. Configure the build (Autotools)==

If you downloaded the source _via_ SVN, first run {{{./autogen.sh}}}.
  * (MAC) It is possible at this point that {{{./autogen.sh}}} will complain that it can't find {{{libtoolize}}}. Fix?

Run {{{./configure}}} to set up the build. The default installation location can be overridden by specifying {{{./configure --prefix=<path>}}}.
  * (MAC) It is necessary to tell {{{./configure}}} which Qt4 installation to use. If you got the disk image from http://trolltech.com then do {{{./configure -with-qt=framework}}}, if running the Fink package of Qt4 do {{{./configure -with-qt=fink}}}. You may also need to direct the build process to the correct Qt4 development binaries either by setting your $PATH to `/sw/lib/qt4-x11/bin:${PATH}' or by invoking {{{./configure}}} with the {{{-with-qtdir=<path>}}} option.
